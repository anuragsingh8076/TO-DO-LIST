# TO-DO-LIST-APP

## 📝 Introduction

This To-Do List Web App is a lightweight and user-friendly task manager built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It is designed to help users organize their daily activities by allowing them to:

* ✅ Add new tasks
* ✏️ Edit existing tasks
* 🗑️ Remove completed or unwanted tasks
* 💾 Save all tasks locally using the browser’s **Local Storage**

Unlike other task managers that require an account or server connection, this app works completely offline. The use of `localStorage` ensures that tasks remain saved even after closing or refreshing the browser, making it ideal for quick note-taking or managing daily goals.

This project also demonstrates the use of key front-end concepts such as:

* DOM manipulation
* Event handling
* Form validation
* Responsive design
* Persistent data storage

Whether you're learning JavaScript or just want a simple tool to keep track of your tasks, this project serves as both a practical utility and a great educational resource.
